                My name is Leo Perez and I've been a student at CSM for about a year now majoring in Computer Science. 
                Recently, I've been working as a private tutor and am excited to venture towards a more IT-orientated career.

    <!-- Reasons for attending CIS 128-->
    <p>
        I am attending this class not only because of the elective requirement, 
        but also because I find being able to understand both front-end and back-end development
        extremely important for those interested in computer science. 
        In the past, I've created a web-scraping program to create statistical models on
        restuarants through yelp. Without the knowledge of how areas of development work and interact, 
        it would have taken me much, much longer to make. It's nice not only to refresh my web development
        skills but to also expand on it in catering webpages for more mobile hardware.
